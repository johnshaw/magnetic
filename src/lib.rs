//! Magnetic contains a set of high-performance queues useful for developing
//! low-latency applications. All queues are FIFO unless otherwise specified.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use std::thread::spawn;
//! use magnetic::spsc::spsc_queue;
//! use magnetic::buffer::dynamic::DynamicBuffer;
//! use magnetic::{Producer, Consumer};
//!
//! let (p, c) = spsc_queue(DynamicBuffer::new(32).unwrap());
//!
//! // Push and pop within a single thread
//! p.push(1).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(c.pop(), Ok(1));
//!
//! // Push and pop from multiple threads. Since this example is using the
//! // SPSC queue, only one producer and one consumer are allowed.
//! let t1 = spawn(move || {
//!     for i in 0..10 {
//!         println!("Producing {}", i);
//!         p.push(i).unwrap();
//!     }
//!     p
//! });
//!
//! let t2 = spawn(move || {
//!     loop {
//!         let i = c.pop().unwrap();
//!         println!("Consumed {}", i);
//!         if i == 9 { break; }
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! t1.join().unwrap();
//! t2.join().unwrap();
//! ```
